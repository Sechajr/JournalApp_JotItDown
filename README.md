Journal-App
Here is my Android App called "Jot It Down", for writing one's daily journals.

Getting started
The app is not published on the android google store yet, but there is ".apk" file for local installation.

#Prerequisites

The app runs on android devices only starting from Android 4.0 (IceCreamSandwich) and above. The app runs perfectly when user is connected to internet for the login, registration and forget password functionalities, but once user is logged in, app can run without internet for the case of writing entries.

#Installing

The app can be installed using the apk file. User will have to copy the file to his/her device memory, on clicking the file, user will be prompted to allow installation. Once allowed, the app will start to install and user will wait till it finnishes. After finnishing installation, the app will be launched to the user's device immediately.
